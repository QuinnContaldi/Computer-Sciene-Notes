    **Types of Analytics.** Indicate which type of analytics (descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive analytics) each of the following represents. #LO_1 
    
    1. a data dashboard
        Descriptive since we are describing something 
    2. a model that finds the production schedule that minimizes overtime
        Prescriptive since we are making decisions 
    3. a model that forecasts sales for the next quarter
        Predictive since we are trying to predict sales based on past information
    4. a bar chart
        Usually Descriptive, since bar charts tend to be used to describe what happened

    **Transportation Planning**. An analytics professional is asked to plan the shipment of a product for the next quarter. She employs the following process:
    
    Step 1.
    For each of the 12 distribution centers, she plots the quarterly demand for the product over the las
    three years.
    
    Step 2.
    Based on the plot for each distribution center, she develops a forecasting model to forecast demand for next quarter for each distribution center.
    
    Step 3.
    She takes the forecast for next quarter for each distribution center and inputs those forecasts, along with the capacities of the company’s four factories and transportation rates from each factory to each distribution center, into an optimization model. The optimization model suggests a shipping plan that minimizes the cost of satisfying the forecasted demand from the company’s four different factories to the distribution centers.
    
    Describe the type of analytics being utilized in each of the three steps outlined above. #LO_1 
	1. This is a Descriptive analytic since we are describing what happened
	2. This is a Predictive analytics since we are using past data to make predictions about the future
	3. This is a Prescriptive analytics since we are using data to make informed decision
