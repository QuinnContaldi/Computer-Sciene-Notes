## Analytics 
#Analytics 
### Descriptive Analytics 
#Descriptive_Analytics 
Is the set of analytical tools that describe what has happened. This includes techniques such as data queries (requests for information with certain characteristics from a database), reports, descriptive or summary statistics, and data visualization. Descriptive data mining techniques such as cluster analysis (grouping data points with similar characteristics) also fall into this category. In general, these techniques summarize existing data or the output from predictive or prescriptive analyses. 

Descriptive what has happened
### Predictive Analytics 
#Predictive_Analytics 
Consists of techniques that use mathematical models constructed from past data to predict future events or better understand the relationships between variables. Techniques in this category include regression analysis, time series forecasting, computer simulation, and predictive data mining. As an example of a predictive model, past weather data are used to build mathematical models that forecast future weather. Likewise, past sales data can be used to predict future sales for seasonal products such as snowblowers, winter coats, and bathing suits. 

Predictive what is going to happen
### Prescriptive Analytics
#Prescriptive_Analytics
Are mathematical or logical models that suggest a decision or course of action. This category includes mathematical optimization models, decision analysis, and heuristic or rule-based systems. For example, solutions to supply network optimization models provide insights into the quantities of a company’s various products that should be manufactured at each plant, how much should be shipped to each of the company’s distribution centers, and which distribution center should serve each customer to minimize cost and meet service constraints. 

Prescriptive I don't have a fucking good one for this so I just think about it as what choice you should make. Maybe prescribing the right choice. Idk
## Types Of Data

### Quantitative data
#Quantitative_Data are data for which numerical values are used to indicate magnitude, such as how many or how much. Arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, can be performed on quantitative data. For instance, because Volume is a quantitative variable, we can sum the values for Volume in Table 1.3 to calculate a total volume of all shares traded by companies included in the Dow. 

how many catgirls is a quantitative data 
### Categorical data
#Categorical_Data are data for which categories of like items are identified by labels or names. Arithmetic operations cannot be performed on categorical data. We can summarize categorical data by counting the number of observations or computing the proportions of observations in each category. For instance, the data in the Industry column in Table 1.3 are categorical. We can count the number of companies in the Dow that are, for example, in the food industry. Table 1.3 shows two companies in the food industry: Coca-Cola and McDonald’s. However, we cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on the data in the Industry column.

### Cross-sectional data
#Cross_Sectional Data collected from several entities at the same or approximately the same point in time.
### Time series data
#Time_Series Data collected over several points in time (minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.).

### Big Data
There is no universally accepted definition of big data. However, probably the most general definition of big data is any set of data that is too large or too complex to be handled by standard data-processing techniques using a typical desktop computer. People refer to the four Vs of big data
#### volume
the amount of data generated
#### velocity
the speed at which the data are generated
#### variety
The diversity in types and structures of data generated
#### veracity
The reliability of the data generated

## Types of Charts and Their Uses 

### Bar Chart
![A bar Chart](BarChart.png)
A chart that shows a summary of categorical data using the length of horizontal bars to display the magnitude of a quantitative variable.

#Bar_Chart shown in Figure 1.3 shows the percentage of the 10,002 survey respondents who listed a factor as the most important in seeking a job. Notice that our attention is drawn to the dark blue bar, which is “Company culture” which is the focus of the article. We immediately see that only “Salary and Bonus” is more frequently cited than “Company Culture.” When you first glance at the chart, the message that is communicated is that corporate culture is the second most important factor cited by job seekers. And as a reader, based on that message, you then decide whether the article is worth reading. 
### Column Chart
![](ColumnChartZoo.png)
A chart that shows numerical data by the height of a column for a variety of categories or time periods.

#Column_Chart helps our intuition and  our experience tells us that we would expect zoo attendance to be highest in the summer months when many school-aged children are out of school for summer break. Figure 1.1 confirms this, as the attendance at the zoo is highest in the summer months of June, July, and August. Furthermore, we see that attendance increases gradually each month from February through May as the average temperature increases, and attendance gradually decreases each month from September through November as the average temperature decreases. But why does the zoo attendance in December and January not follow these patterns? It turns out the zoo has an event known as the “Festival of Lights” that runs from the end of November through early January. Children are out of school during the last half of December and early January for the holiday season, and this leads to increased attendance in the evenings at the zoo despite the colder winter temperatures. 
### Control Chart 
![](ControlChart.png)
A graphical display in which a variable of interest is plotted over time relative to lower and upper control limits.

#Control_Chart is a graphical display that is used to help determine if a production process is in control or out of control. A variable of interest is plotted over time relative to lower and upper control limits. Consider the control chart for the production of 10-pound bags of dog food shown in Figure 1.11. Every minute, a bag is diverted from the line and automatically weighed. The result is plotted along with lower and upper control limits obtained statistically from historical data. When the points are between the lower and upper control limits, the process is considered to be in control. When points begin to appear outside the control limits with some regularity and/or when large swings start to appear as in Figure 1.11, this is a signal to inspect the process and make any necessary corrections. 

### Clustered Column Chart Benford's Law
![](Clustered-Column-Chart.png)
#Clustered_Column_Chart
A column chart showing multiple variables of interest on the same chart, with the different variables usually denoted by different colors or shades of a color with the columns side by side.

#Benfords_Law can be used to detect fraud. If the first digits of numbers in a data set do not conform to Bedford’s Law, then further investigation of fraud may be warranted. Consider the accounts payable for Tucker Software. Figure 1.6 is a clustered column chart, also known as a side-by-side column chart. A clustered column chart is a column chart that shows multiple variables of interest on the same chart, with the different variables usually denoted by different colors or shades of a color. In Figure 1.6, the two variables are Benford’s Law probability and the first digit data for a random sample of 500 of Tucker’s accounts payable entries. The frequency of occurrence in the data is used to estimate the probability of the first digit for all of Tucker’s accounts payable entries. It appears that there are an inordinate number of first digits of 5 and 9 and a lower than expected number of first digits of 1. These might warrant further investigation by Tucker’s auditors. 
### Funnel Chart
![](FunnelChart.png)
A chart that shows the progression of a numerical variable to typically smaller values through a process, for example, the percentage of website visitors who ultimately result in a sale.

#Funnel_Chart is a chart that shows the progression of a numerical variable for various categories from larger to smaller values. In Figure 1.9, at the top of the funnel, we track 100% of the first-time visitors to the website over some period of time, for example, a six-month period. The funnel chart shows that of those original visitors, 74% return to the website one or more times after their initial visit. Sixty-one percent of the first-time visitors downloaded a 30-day trial version of the software, 47% eventually contacted support services, 28% purchased a one-year subscription to the software, and 17% eventually renewed their subscription. This type of funnel chart can be used to compare the conversion effectiveness of different website configurations, the use of bots, or changes in support services. 
### High Low Close Stock Chart
![](HighLow.png)
A chart that shows three numerical values: high value, low value, and closing value for the price of a share of stock over time.

#High_Low_Close_Stock_Chart  chart that shows the high value, low value, and closing value of the price of a share of stock over time. For each date shown, the bar indicates the range of the stock price per share on that day, and the labeled point on the bar indicates closing price per share for that day. The chart shows how the closing price is changing over time and the volatility of the price on each day. 
### Scatter Chart
![](ScatterChart.png)
A graphical presentation of the relationship between two quantitative variables. One variable is shown on the horizontal axis, and the other is shown on the vertical axis.

#Scatter_Chart are used to better understand the relationship between the two variables under consideration. Even though the two different data sets have the same average values and standard deviations of X and Y, the respective relationships between X and Y are different. 
### Shot Chart
![](ShotChart.png)
A chart that displays the location of shots attempted by a basketball player during a basketball game with different symbols or colors indicating successful and unsuccessful shots.

#Shot_Chart shows an example of how data visualization is used in basketball. A shot chart is a chart that displays the location of the shots attempted by a player during a basketball game with different symbols or colors indicating successful and unsuccessful shots. Figure 1.12 shows shot attempts by NBA player Chris Paul, with a blue dot indicating a successful shot and an orange x indicating a missed shot (source: Basketball-Reference.com). Other NBA teams can utilize this chart to help devise strategies for defending Chris Paul. 
### Spaghetti Chart
![](SpaghettiChart.png)
A chart depicting possible flows through a system using a line for each possible path.

#Spaghetti_Chart Predicting the path a hurricane will follow is a complicated problem. Numerous models, each with its own set of influencing variables, also known as model features, yield different predictions. Displaying the results of each model on a map gives a sense of the uncertainty in predicted paths across all models and expands the alert to a broader range of the population than relying on a single model. Because the multiple paths resemble pieces of spaghetti, this type of map is sometimes referred to as a “spaghetti chart.” More generally, a spaghetti chart is a chart depicting possible flows through a system using a line for each possible path. 
### Stacked Chart
![](Stacked.png)


#Stacked_Column_Chart, is an example of a visual display of employee turnover. It shows gains and losses of employees by month. A stacked column chart is a column chart that shows part-to-whole comparisons, either over time or across categories. Different colors or shades of color are used to denote the different parts of the whole within a column. In Figure 1.8, gains in employees (new hires) are represented by positive numbers in darker blue and losses (people leaving the company) are presented as negative numbers and lighter blue bars
### Time Series Chart
![](TimeSeries.png)
Data collected over several points in time (minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.).
#Time_Series_Data_Chart are data collected over several points in time (minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.). Graphs of time series data are frequently found in business, economic, and science publications. Such graphs help analysts understand what happened in the past, identify trends over time, and project future levels for the time series. For example, the graph of the time series in Figure 1.4 shows the DJI value from January 2013 to August 2023.
