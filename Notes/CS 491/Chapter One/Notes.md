## Analytics 
#Analytics 
### Descriptive Analytics 
#Descriptive_Analytics 
Is the set of analytical tools that describe what has happened. This includes techniques such as data queries (requests for information with certain characteristics from a database), reports, descriptive or summary statistics, and data visualization. Descriptive data mining techniques such as cluster analysis (grouping data points with similar characteristics) also fall into this category. In general, these techniques summarize existing data or the output from predictive or prescriptive analyses. 

Descriptive what has happened
### Predictive Analytics 
#Predictive_Analytics 
Consists of techniques that use mathematical models constructed from past data to predict future events or better understand the relationships between variables. Techniques in this category include regression analysis, time series forecasting, computer simulation, and predictive data mining. As an example of a predictive model, past weather data are used to build mathematical models that forecast future weather. Likewise, past sales data can be used to predict future sales for seasonal products such as snowblowers, winter coats, and bathing suits. 

Predictive what is going to happen
### Prescriptive Analytics
#Prescriptive_Analytics
Are mathematical or logical models that suggest a decision or course of action. This category includes mathematical optimization models, decision analysis, and heuristic or rule-based systems. For example, solutions to supply network optimization models provide insights into the quantities of a company’s various products that should be manufactured at each plant, how much should be shipped to each of the company’s distribution centers, and which distribution center should serve each customer to minimize cost and meet service constraints. 

Prescriptive I don't have a fucking good one for this so I just think about it as what choice you should make. Maybe prescribing the right choice. Idk
## Types Of Data

### Quantitative data
#Quantitative_Data are data for which numerical values are used to indicate magnitude, such as how many or how much. Arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, can be performed on quantitative data. For instance, because Volume is a quantitative variable, we can sum the values for Volume in Table 1.3 to calculate a total volume of all shares traded by companies included in the Dow.

### Categorical data
#Categorical_Data are data for which categories of like items are identified by labels or names. Arithmetic operations cannot be performed on categorical data. We can summarize categorical data by counting the number of observations or computing the proportions of observations in each category. For instance, the data in the Industry column in Table 1.3 are categorical. We can count the number of companies in the Dow that are, for example, in the food industry. Table 1.3 shows two companies in the food industry: Coca-Cola and McDonald’s. However, we cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on the data in the Industry column.

### Cross-sectional data
#Cross_Sectional Data collected from several entities at the same or approximately the same point in time.
### Time series data
#Time_Series Data collected over several points in time (minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.).

### Big Data
There is no universally accepted definition of big data. However, probably the most general definition of big data is any set of data that is too large or too complex to be handled by standard data-processing techniques using a typical desktop computer. People refer to the four Vs of big data
#### volume
the amount of data generated
#### velocity
the speed at which the data are generated
#### variety
The diversity in types and structures of data generated
#### veracity
The reliability of the data generated
